## Assignment 7. Reading Assignment for Machine Learning on Relational Database

### Learning Goal:
- Understand the motivating factor of running machine learning in RDBMS: declarative programming, automatic query optimization, normalized data model, and etc.  
- Understand the challenges of running machine learning in RDBMS: recursive interface, how to represent tensors , and etc.  
- Understand the current state of arts in running machine learning in RDBMS.  


### Tasks:
1. Select two papers from the list of papers for Assignment 7
2. Write three 1-page reviews, one review for each paper:
    - Each review must include three parts: 
    - Summary of the paper
    - Three strengths of the paper
    - Three weaknesses of the paper
